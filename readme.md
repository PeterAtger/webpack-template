# Webpack-template

## I'll use this as a template to jumpstart future products

Each branch should hold a template for a different project type, the base will always be tailewind and typescirpt, but in the future will add templates for:
* React projects
* ThreeJs projects
* PWA projects for react

### To start a development server use: `y start` , it will start on localhost:8080
### To build a project for production use: `y build`, the output will be in 'public' folder
